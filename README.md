## How to run this

### Get the input files

The input files in `src/main/resources` are encrypted. If you're not me, you'll need
to download the relevant input files from the AoC website and replace the encrypted ones
in that directory.

### Run the code

You can run the Part* classes within IntelliJ interactively.

To run using the command line, install maven, then run `mvn package appassembler:assemble`
to build the application.

Run the main program, supplying the day and part you want to run as arguments:

```sh
# runs day 2, part 1 
target/appassembler/bin/aoc2025 2 1
# runs day 3, both parts
target/appassembler/bin/aoc2025 3
# run everything
target/appassembler/bin/aoc2025 all
```
